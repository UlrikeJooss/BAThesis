# BAThesis: The Electronic Appendix of my Bachelor Thesis

Topic:
The Influence of Psychosocial Factors on the Intention to Pursue a Master’s Programme after the Bachelor’s Degree. 
An Analysis Based on the 2021 German Student Survey conducted by DZHW


For detailed insights and full transparency of the analysis, I am publishing my script. 

Additionally, I provide a rendered HTML version where all inputs and outputs are clearly structured and visible,
offering the most comfortable way to view the whole analysing process.

This study was conducted using the programming language R and RMarkdown, tools designed for reproducible research.

The .Rmd- file includes:
•	Sample Construction
•	Variable Construction
•	All Testing Procedures
•	All Regression Equations
•	All Visualisations
•	Formulary
